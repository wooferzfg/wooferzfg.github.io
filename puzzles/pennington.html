<div class="puzzle-page-header">Rules</div>
<p>Normal Irregular Sudoku rules apply, but the regions must be determined by the solver. All regions are orthogonally connected groups of 9 cells. Some region borders are given.</p>
<p>A digit in a cell with arrows indicates the number of cells seen in the indicated directions combined, including itself. Region borders obstruct vision.</p>
