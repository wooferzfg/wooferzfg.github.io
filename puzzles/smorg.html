<div class="puzzle-page-header">Rules</div>

<p>Fill some cells in the grid with the digits 1-9 such that no digit repeats in a row or column, and some cells are left empty.</p>
<p>All empty cells in the grid must be orthogonally connected.</p>
<p>All digits must belong to a region, which is an orthogonally connected group of 9 non-empty cells. Digits may not repeat in a region. Regions may not touch each other orthogonally.</p>
<p>Clues outside the grid give the sum of the digits before the first empty cell seen from that direction.</p>
<p>A digit in a circle indicates how many of the 8 surrounding cells are empty. A cell with a circle must contain a digit. Not all circles are necessarily given.</p>
