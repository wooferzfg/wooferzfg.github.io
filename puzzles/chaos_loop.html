<div class="puzzle-page-header">Rules</div>
<p>Normal Irregular Sudoku rules apply, but the regions must be determined by the solver. All regions are orthogonally connected groups of 9 cells.</p>
<p>Draw a single non-intersecting loop that travels orthogonally through the centers of some cells which passes through each region exactly once.</p>
<p>A digit in a cell with arrows indicates the total number of cells in the same region as that cell that are visited by the loop, in the indicated directions combined, including itself.</p>
