<div class="puzzle-page-header">Rules</div>
<p>Normal Sudoku rules apply.</p>
<p>There are hidden lockout lines in the grid. Each pair of diamonds with the same letter must be connected by a line. Lines can only move orthogonally and cannot branch. Lines cannot cross themselves, other lines, or other diamonds.</p>
<p>Digits on a lockout line cannot be between or equal to the digits on the diamond endpoints. Digits on the endpoints must differ by at least 4.</p>
