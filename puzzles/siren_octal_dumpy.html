<div class="puzzle-page-header">Rules</div>
<p>Normal Sudoku rules apply.</p>

<p>There is a secret five digit number. The colored squares in a row, read left to right as a five digit number, represent a guess at the secret number:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a cell is green, that digit is in the secret number and in the correct position.</li>
<li>If a cell is yellow, that digit is in the secret number, but in the wrong position.</li>
<li>If a cell is gray, that digit is not in the secret number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cells marked by a black dot must have a ratio of 2:1. Cells marked by a white dot must be consecutive. Not all dots are given.</p>
