<p>This puzzle is a variant of U-Bahn. The rules previously appeared in puzzles by <a target="_blank" href="https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=000IM8">uvo</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=000IHM">Zzzyxas</a>.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with U-Bahn, here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/6t5wzf2x">guide that covers the core logic</a>.</p>
<div class="puzzle-page-header">Rules</div>
<p>Draw a loop network through the centers of some cells, which may branch or turn, but may not have any dead ends.</p>
<p>A clue outside the grid indicates how many times the corresponding line shape (i.e. a cross, branch, straight line, or turn) appears in the corresponding row or column, irrespective of the line shape's rotation.</p>
<p>In each cage, every possible line shape must occur exactly once in every possible orientation (one empty cell, one cross, four branches, two straight lines, and four turns). The possible line shapes for each cage are shown to the right of the puzzle.</p>
