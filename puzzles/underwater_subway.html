<p>This puzzle is a combination of a U-Bahn and a Nurikabe (without the restriction on 2x2 areas).</p>
<div class="puzzle-page-header">Rules</div>
<p>Draw a loop network through the centers of some empty cells, which may branch or turn, but may not have any dead ends.</p>
<p>A clue outside the grid indicates how many times the corresponding line shape (i.e. a cross, branch, straight line, or turn) appears in the corresponding row or column, irrespective of the line shape's rotation.</p>
<p>Every orthogonally connected area of cells not visited by the loop network contains exactly one clue, the value of which represents the size of the area. A "?" can represent any non-zero size.</p>
