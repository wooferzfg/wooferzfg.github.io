<div class="puzzle-page-header">Rules</div>
<p>Normal Irregular Sudoku rules apply, but the regions must be determined by the solver. All regions are orthogonally connected groups of 9 cells.</p>
<p>A digit in a circle indicates how many region borders between the 9 surrounding cells touch the region which contains the cell with the circle. The edge of the grid does not count towards the total.</p>
<p>A digit in a square indicates how many of the 9 surrounding cells (including itself) belong to the same region as the cell with the square.</p>
<p>Not all circles and squares are necessarily given.</p>
