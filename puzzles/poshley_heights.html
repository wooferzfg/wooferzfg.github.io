<p>This puzzle is named after <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Poshley_Heights">a village in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>. The rules, which combine U-Bahn with Skyscrapers, originate from <a target="_blank" href="https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=000DOA">a puzzle by KNT</a>.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with U-Bahn, here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/6t5wzf2x">guide that covers the core logic</a>.</p>
<div class="puzzle-page-header">Rules</div>
<p>Draw a totally connected loop network through the centers of some unshaded cells, which may branch or turn, but may not have any dead ends.</p>
<p>In the rectangular areas outside the grid on the top and left, a clue indicates how many times the corresponding line shape (i.e. a cross, branch, straight line, or turn) appears in the corresponding row or column, irrespective of the line shape's rotation.</p>
<p>Assign a value to each line shape:<br>
turn = 1<br>
straight line = 2<br>
branch = 3<br>
cross = 4</p>
<p>A clue directly outside the grid is a Skyscrapers clue, which indicates how many cells in the corresponding row or column contain a larger value than all cells before it from the direction of the clue.</p>
