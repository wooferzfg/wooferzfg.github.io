<p>The rules for this puzzle are similar to a <a target="_blank" href="https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Suche/erweitert.php?skname=x&suchtext=U-Bahn%20unter%20Hochh%C3%A4usern&suchautor=Zzzyxas">series by Zzzyxas</a>. There is also a <a target="_blank" href="https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=000MR2">puzzle by KNT with similar rules</a>.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with U-Bahn, here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/6t5wzf2x">guide that covers the core logic</a>.</p>
<div class="puzzle-page-header">Rules</div>
<p>The first diagram is a standard U-Bahn. Draw a loop network through the centers of some cells, which may branch or turn, but may not have any dead ends. A clue outside the grid indicates how many times the corresponding line shape (i.e. a cross, branch, straight line, or turn) appears in the corresponding row or column, irrespective of the line shape's rotation.</p>
<p>The second diagram is a 6x6 Latin Square. Place the numbers from 1 to 6 exactly once in every row and column. Numbers on arrows must sum to the number in the circle.</p>
<p>The third diagram indicates exactly how many times a cell of the Latin Square contains the given number and the same relative cell of the U-Bahn contains the given line shape.</p>
