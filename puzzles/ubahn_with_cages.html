<p>This puzzle is a variant of U-Bahn.</p>

<div class="puzzle-page-header">Rules</div>
<p>Draw a totally connected loop network through the centers of some unshaded cells, which may branch or turn, but may not have any dead ends.</p>
<p>A clue outside the grid indicates how many times the corresponding line shape (i.e. a cross, branch, straight line, or turn) appears in the corresponding row or column, irrespective of the line shape's rotation.</p>
<p>Within a cage, any cells that are visited by the loop network must have the same line shape, irrespective of rotation. Different cages may have different line shapes, and cages may be empty.</p>
