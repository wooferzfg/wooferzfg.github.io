<div class="puzzle-page-header">Rules</div>
<p>Normal Irregular Sudoku rules apply, but the regions must be determined by the solver. All regions are orthogonally connected groups of 9 cells.</p>
<p>The blue line is a region sum line. Digits on the line have an equal sum N within each region it passes through. If the line passes through the same region more than once, each individual segment of the line within that region sums to N separately.</p>
